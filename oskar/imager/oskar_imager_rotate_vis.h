/**
 * @brief
 * Performs visibility amplitude phase rotation to a new phase centre.
 *
 * @details
 * This function performs visibility amplitude phase rotation to a new phase
 * centre.
 *
 * Prior to calling this function, the new phase centre must be set first
 * using oskar_imager_set_direction(), and then the original phase centre
 * must be set using oskar_imager_set_vis_phase_centre().
 * Note that the order of these function calls is important.
 *
 * Note that the coordinates (uu_in, vv_in, ww_in) correspond to the original
 * phase centre, and must be in wavelengths.
 *
 * Reference:
 * Cornwell, T.J., & Perley, R.A., 1992,
 * "Radio-interferometric imaging of very large fields"
 *
 * @param[in] h             Handle to imager.
 * @param[in] num_vis       Number of visibilities.
 * @param[in] uu_in         Original baseline UU coordinates, in wavelengths.
 * @param[in] vv_in         Original baseline VV coordinates, in wavelengths.
 * @param[in] ww_in         Original baseline WW coordinates, in wavelengths.
 * @param[in,out] amps      Complex visibility amplitudes.
