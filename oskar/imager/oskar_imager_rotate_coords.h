/**
 * @brief
 * Rotate baseline coordinates to a new phase centre.
 *
 * @details
 * This function rotates a set of baseline coordinates to a new phase centre.
 *
 * Prior to calling this function, the new phase centre must be set first
 * using oskar_imager_set_direction(), and then the original phase centre
 * must be set using oskar_imager_set_vis_phase_centre().
 * Note that the order of these function calls is important.
 *
 * @param[in] h             Handle to imager.
 * @param[in] num_coords    Number of baseline coordinates.
 * @param[in] uu_in         Input baseline UU coordinates.
 * @param[in] vv_in         Input baseline VV coordinates.
 * @param[in] ww_in         Input baseline WW coordinates.
 * @param[out] uu_out       Output baseline UU coordinates.
 * @param[out] vv_out       Output baseline VV coordinates.
 * @param[out] ww_out       Output baseline WW coordinates.
