/**
 * @brief
 * Creates an aliased pointer from an existing one.
 *
 * @details
 * This function creates a handle to an OSKAR memory block that contains an
 * aliased pointer to (part of) an existing memory block. The structure does
 * not own the memory to which it points.
 *
 * To create an empty alias, set \p src to NULL. The source alias can be set
 * later using oskar_mem_set_alias().
 *
 * A handle to the memory is returned. The handle must be deallocated
 * using oskar_mem_free() when it is no longer required.
 *
 * @param[in] src           Handle to source memory block (may be NULL).
 * @param[in] offset        Offset number of elements from start of source memory block.
 * @param[in] num_elements  Number of elements in the returned array.
 * @param[in,out]  status   Status return code.
 *
 * @return A handle to the aliased memory block structure.
