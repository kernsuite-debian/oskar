 * @class SettingsItem
 *
 * @brief SettingsItem container class.
 *
 * @details
 * Container class for a setting.
 *
 * A setting has the following parameters:
 * - key: Key used to identify a setting.
 * - label: Brief description of the setting.
 * - description: Detailed description of the setting.
 * - value: The value of the setting.
 * - required flag: Flag indicating that the setting is required.
 * - priority level: Used to mark high priority settings.
 * - dependencies: Dependency tree used to determine if the setting is active.
 *
 * The settings value is a object of @class SettingsValue, this is a stack-
 * based discriminated union container which holds the value and default value
 * of the setting as a well defined type.
 *
 * Settings priority can be used to mark a setting as important. This can be
 * used for example to control if a setting which has not been set should
 * be written to the log or appear in the settings file.
 *
 * SettingsItem can depend on other settings items as specified by the
 * dependency tree.
