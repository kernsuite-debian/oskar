 * @details
 * This function loads a element gain and phase data from a comma- or
 * space-separated text file. Each line contains data for one element
 * of the station.
 *
 * The file may have the following columns, in the following order:
 * - Element amplitude gain factor (default 1).
 * - Element phase offset in degrees (default 0).
 * - Element amplitude gain error (default 0).
 * - Element phase error in degrees (default 0).
 *
 * @param[out] station   Pointer to destination data structure to fill.
 * @param[in] filename   Name of the data file to load.
 * @param[in,out] status Status return code.
