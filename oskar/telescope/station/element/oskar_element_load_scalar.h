 * @brief
 * Loads a scalar antenna pattern from an ASCII text file.
 *
 * @details
 * This function loads scalar antenna pattern data from a text file and fills
 * the provided data structure.
 *
 * The data file must contain at least three columns, in the following order:
 * - <theta, deg>
 * - <phi, deg>
 * - <amplitude>
 * - <phase, deg> [optional]
 *
 * @param[in,out] data         Pointer to element model data structure to fill.
 * @param[in,out] log          Pointer to log structure to use.
 * @param[in]  freq_hz         Frequency at which element data applies, in Hz.
 * @param[in]  filename        Data file name.
 * @param[in]  closeness       Target average fractional error required (<< 1).
 * @param[in]  closeness_inc   Average fractional error factor increase (> 1).
 * @param[in]  ignore_at_poles If set, ignore data at theta = 0 and theta = 180.
 * @param[in]  ignore_below_horizon If set, ignore data at theta > 90 deg.
 * @param[in,out] status       Status return code.
