 * @brief
 * Sets data for an aliased pointer.
 *
 * @details
 * This function sets the meta-data in a structure to set up a pointer alias
 * to existing memory. The destination structure must not own the memory to
 * which it points, so it must have been created using an
 * oskar_mem_create_alias*() function.
 *
 * @param[in] src           Handle to destination memory block.
 * @param[in] src           Handle to source memory block.
 * @param[in] offset        Offset number of elements from start of source memory block.
 * @param[in] num_elements  Number of elements in the returned array.
 * @param[in,out]  status   Status return code.
