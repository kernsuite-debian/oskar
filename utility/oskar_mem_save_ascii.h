/**
 * @brief
 * Saves the given blocks of memory to an ASCII table.
 *
 * @details
 * This function saves the given blocks of memory to an ASCII table using the
 * specified stream.
 *
 * The variable argument list must contain pointers to oskar_Mem structures.
 * Data within these structures may reside either in CPU or GPU memory.
 * The number of structures passed is given by the \p num_mem parameter.
 *
 * All structures must contain at least the number of specified
 * \p num_elements. Each array will form one (or more, if using complex types)
 * columns of the output table, with the row corresponding to the element
 * index.
 *
 * @param[in] file          Pointer to output stream.
 * @param[in] num_mem       Number of arrays to write.
 * @param[in] num_elements  Number of elements to write.
 * @param[in,out]  status   Status return code.
