/**
 * @brief
 * Sets the value of all elements in a vector.
 *
 * @details
 * This function sets all the values in a block of memory to the same, real,
 * value. For complex types, the imaginary components are set to zero, and
 * for matrix types, the off-diagonal elements are set to zero.
 *
 * Note that a value of zero for both the \p offset and \p length parameters
 * will cause the entire array to be set.
 *
 * Integer types will cause an error code to be returned.
 *
 * @param[in] mem Pointer to the block of memory to update.
 * @param[in] val All memory elements will be set to this value.
 * @param[in] offset Array index offset at which to start.
 * @param[in] length Number of array elements to set, starting at offset.
 *                   Note that 0 for both \p offset and \p length means "all".
 * @param[in,out]  status   Status return code.
