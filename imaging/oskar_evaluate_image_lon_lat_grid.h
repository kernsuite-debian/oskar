 * @param[out] lat          Output pixel positions in latitude, in radians.
 * @param[in]  image_size_l Image side length in the l-dimension, in pixels.
 * @param[in]  image_size_m Image side length in the m-dimension, in pixels.
 * @param[in]  fov_rad_lon  Field-of-view in longitude (l-dimension), in radians.
 * @param[in]  fov_rad_lat  Field-of-view in latitude (m-dimension), in radians.
 * @param[in]  lon_rad      Image centre longitude, in radians.
