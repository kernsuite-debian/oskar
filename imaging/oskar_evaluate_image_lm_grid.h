 * @brief
 * Generate a grid on the tangent plane suitable for use with a FITS image.
 *
 * @details
 * This function computes (orthographic) tangent-plane positions on a grid
 * that can be used to make a FITS image.
 *
 * Note that FITS images conventionally have the <b>largest</b> value of
 * RA (=longitude) and the <b>smallest</b> value of DEC (=latitude) at the
 * lowest memory address, so therefore the grid l-values must start off
 * positive and go negative, while the grid m-values start off negative
 * and go positive.
 *
 * The fastest-varying dimension is along l (longitude axis) and the slowest
 * varying is along m (latitude axis).
 *
 * The output arrays \p grid_l and \p grid_m must each be pre-sized large
 * enough to hold \p num_l * \p num_m points.
 *
 * The axes l and m are towards the East and North (in the same direction as
 * baseline dimensions u and v), respectively: see "Interferometry and
 * Synthesis in Radio Astronomy" figure 4.1 (1986 edition) or
 * figure 3.2 (2001 edition); "l and m are the direction cosines measured with
 * respect to the axes u and v." (page 71, 2001 edition).
 *
 * @param[out] l       The output list of l-direction cosines.
 * @param[out] m       The output list of m-direction cosines.
 * @param[in]  nl      Number of required grid points in the longitude dimension.
 * @param[in]  nm      Number of required grid points in the latitude dimension.
 * @param[in]  fov_lon The field of view in longitude (image width) in radians.
 * @param[in]  fov_lat The field of view in latitude (image height) in radians.
