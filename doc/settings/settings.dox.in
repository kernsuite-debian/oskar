\section settings_intro Introduction
This document describes the settings files used by OSKAR applications, which
use the INI plain-text file format.

<b>
Note that if you are using the OSKAR GUI, the settings descriptions are
available as tool-tips, and you should not need to refer to this document.
</b>

Settings are defined simply using key-value pairs, for example:

\verbatim
simulator/double_precision=true
observation/start_time_utc=01-01-2000 12:01:02.000
observation/length=06:00:00.000
\endverbatim

Settings can also be grouped into sections. For example, the above can also be
written as:

\verbatim
[simulator]
double_precision=true

[observation]
start_time_utc=01-01-2000 12:01:02.000
length=06:00:00.000
\endverbatim

Settings files can be written or modified using any text editor, or by using the
<tt>--set</tt> command line flag when running the application,
or (the recommended method) by using the OSKAR GUI.

The following section describes the currently available settings.

\section settings_settings Settings used by OSKAR applications
The following section describes the possible options that can be currently used
in OSKAR settings files. The settings file is arranged into a number of groups,
which are described in the subsections below.

Required parameters are marked with a dagger symbol (\f$\dagger\f$).

<!--
\subsection settings_allowed_values A note on allowed values
- MAX represents the maximum representable value for the type.
- Bool types should be set as the strings, true or false.

    <td>Updated for version 2.1.1-beta.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>2013-03-01</td>
    <td>Updated settings for version 2.2.0. This includes changes to most
    settings in the sky model group, and changes to the settings that define
    the files saved from beam pattern simulations.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>2013-11-13</td>
    <td>Updated settings for version 2.3.0. This consists of an update to
    the specification of beam pattern simulation settings.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>2014-07-17</td>
    <td>Updated settings for version 2.5.0. Moved element pattern fitting
    parameters out of the telescope model group to the
    top-level 'element_fit' group. Added global beam normalization option.
    Added isotropic beam station type. Added Gaussian station beam reference
    frequency. Added dipole length options. Added UV range filtering
    parameters. Added scalar mode option. Removed option to make image
    after interferometer simulation.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>2014-09-08</td>
    <td>Updated descriptions in system noise settings to clarify that the
    noise is specified for a single polarisation.  Changed all random
    number seed integer ranges to start at 1 (rather than 0). Changed beam
    normalization to be enabled by default.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>2015-04-28</td>
    <td>Moved option to select polarisation mode into telescope model settings
    group, so that scalar mode can also be used for beam pattern
    simulations. Moved and renamed option to allow station beam duplication
    into telescope model group. Added option to disable horizon clip in
    advanced sky model settings. Re-wrote most of the beam pattern options to
    support the new output modes.
    Added the ability to use seconds (as well as hours, minutes and seconds)
    to specify observation length. Removed options to write OSKAR image
    files. Removed ability to load a GSM file directly or use HEALPix
    temperature maps, as the frequency scaling was not treated
    correctly.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>2017-01-05</td>
    <td>Added new imager settings. Removed telescope position settings
    (these are now specified in the telescope model folder).
    Updated beam pattern output settings.
    Reinstated GSM and HEALPix sky model settings.</td></tr>
