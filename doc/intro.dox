\section intro_intro What is OSKAR?

The OSKAR package consists of a number of open source applications for the
simulation of astronomical radio interferometers.
OSKAR 2.x has been designed primarily to produce simulated data from
telescopes that use aperture arrays, as envisaged for the SKA.

\section intro_features Features

Below is a summary of the current features of the OSKAR package.

- **Simulation capability:**
  - Evaluation of a polarised Radio Interferometer Measurement Equation,
    accelerated using NVIDIA GPU(s).
  - Extensible framework using Jones matrix formalism.
  - Optimised for simulation using very large source catalogues.
  - Capable of simulating interferometers constructed from large aperture
    arrays.
  - Sky models:
    - Input catalogues of point and/or elliptical Gaussian sources.
    - Built-in sky model generators for random power-law,
      random broken-power-law, and gridded source distributions.
  - Station beam response:
    - Direct evaluation of aperture array station beams (E Jones) from
      arbitrary telescope configurations (using either single level or
      hierarchical beam forming schemes). Options include:
      - Independent specification of pointing direction for each station or
        tile.
      - Apodisation weighting.
      - Antenna element position and dipole orientation errors.
      - Systematic and random element phase and gain errors.
    - Inclusion of (embedded) antenna element patterns specified by an
      analytical dipole response or a numerically defined pattern, as a
      function of element type and frequency.
    - Inclusion of parallactic angle rotation.
  - Interferometric response allows for:
    - Time and bandwidth smearing.
    - Uncorrelated system noise.
    - Filtering as a function of baseline UV distance.
- **An application to simulate interferometer data**
  - Configurable using INI format settings files.
  - Export to CASA Measurement Set format.
- **An application to simulate aperture array beam patterns**
  - Configurable using INI format settings files.
  - Export to FITS image format.
- **A simple graphical user interface application for setting up and running
  simulations.**
- **A number of utility applications to provide support for scripting of
  simulations.**
- **Supported and tested on Linux and macOS.**

\section intro_faq FAQ

This section attempts to address some frequently asked questions about OSKAR.
If you have a question that is not answered here, please send it to
oskar@oerc.ox.ac.uk and we will do our best to respond.

-# <b>Which operating systems/platforms are supported?</b><br>
OSKAR has been tested to compile and run correctly on various recent Linux
distributions, and recent versions of macOS and Windows.
If you encounter a problem with OSKAR, please report it to oskar@oerc.ox.ac.uk.

-# <b>Does OSKAR require an NVIDIA GPU to work?</b><br>
No, but simulations will probably run faster if an NVIDIA GPU is available.
Other GPUs are not currently supported.

-# <b>Which GPU model should I use to run OSKAR simulations?</b><br>
OSKAR should be able to run on an NVIDIA GPU with compute capability of 2.0
or higher. We recommend using a dedicated compute card which has decent
double precision floating point performance, as consumer gaming models only
work well in single precision (the exception being the Kepler NVIDIA Titans).
Recent OSKAR simulations have been running successfully using NVIDIA's
K20 and K40 compute cards in HPC clusters.

-# <b>I have multiple NVIDIA GPUs in my computer.
Can OSKAR make use of all of them to run faster?</b><br>
Yes, normally, as the CUDA device(s) to use can be specified at
run-time, and work is shared between them by splitting up the sky model and
the time samples within a visibility block. However, see also the answer to
the next question to check if using multiple GPUs in this way will be
worthwhile for you.

-# <b>Why does OSKAR run at virtually the same speed regardless of whether I
use a sky model containing 10 sources or 100 sources?</b><br>
OSKAR was designed to run simulations efficiently for aperture-array-based
telescopes using large sky models containing many thousands of sources across
the whole sky. This is done by assigning a GPU thread for every source.
However, as modern GPUs have thousands of processing cores, there must be
enough work to do to keep the GPU occupied in this way. If your sky model
contains only 100 sources, you may be using only a few percent of the
available hardware, so performance will be relatively poor when using small
sky models like this. It will probably be faster to use CPU cores only for
sky models containing fewer than 32 sources.

-# <b>Is OpenCL supported?</b><br>
No. However, depending on demand, support for OpenCL could potentially be
added in a future release.

-# <b>Are pre-built binary packages of OSKAR available?</b><br>
Binary installer packages are now available for macOS and Windows systems.
On Linux, OSKAR still needs to be compiled from source.

-# <b>I found a bug!</b><br>
Please let us know by sending an email to oskar@oerc.ox.ac.uk.

-# <b>I found a bug, but I managed to fix it!</b><br>
Wonderful! Please send us your patch by sending an email to
oskar@oerc.ox.ac.uk. We'll test it and integrate it back into the master branch.

-# <b>Please could you add this feature?</b><br>
Please get in touch - we will certainly consider new features but can't
guarantee that we can implement all of them.

\section intro_roadmap Roadmap

We hope to add the following capabilities to OSKAR at some point.
In no particular order:

- Allow use of analytical and numerical dish patterns.
- Swap X and Y dipoles to match IAU polarisation axes on the sky.
- Allow full 3D specification of individual element feed angles.
- Allow full Stokes beam patterns.
- Include a usable ionospheric model.
