/**
 * @brief Evaluates pierce points for a station for a number of directions.
 *
 * @details
 * This function is based on the MeqTrees script Lions/PiercePoints.py
 * which was developed by Maaijke Mevius and Ilse van Bemmel, and
 * can be found in the MeqTrees cattery repository.
 *
 * Possible problems:
 * - Pierce points below the horizon are still evaluated.
 *
 * @param[out] pierce_point_lon      Array of pierce point longitudes, in radians.
 * @param[out] pierce_point_lat      Array of pierce point latitudes, in radians.
 * @param[out] relative_path_length  Array of relative path lengths in the direction
 *                                   of the pierce point from the station
 *                                   [sec(alpha_prime)].
 * @param[in] station_x_ecef    Station x (earth centred, earth fixed
 *                              /ITRF/geocentric) coordinate.
 * @param[in] station_x_ecef    Station y (earth centred, earth fixed
 *                              /ITRF/geocentric) coordinate.
 * @param[in] station_z_ecef    Station z (earth centred, earth fixed
 *                              /ITRF/geocentric) coordinate.
 * @param[in] screen_height_m   Height of the screen though which to calculate
 *                              pierce points, in metres.
 * @param[in] num_directions    Number of directions for which to calculate
 *                              pierce points.
 * @param[in] hor_x             Array of horizontal x direction cosines for
 *                              which to evaluate pierce points.
 * @param[in] hor_y             Array of horizontal y direction cosines for
 *                              which to evaluate pierce points.
 * @param[in] hor_z             Array of horizontal z direction cosines for
 *                              which to evaluate pierce points.
 * @param[in,out] status        Error status code.
