 * Overrides element dipole orientations in a station model.

 * This function overrides element orientations in a station model using the
 * supplied standard deviation.
 *
 * Only the orientations at the deepest (element) level are set.
 *
 * The station model must be in CPU-accessible memory.
 *
 * @param[in,out] s            Station model structure to modify.
 * @param[in] seed             Random generator seed.
 * @param[in] x_pol            If true, override X dipole angles; else Y dipole.
 * @param[in] alpha_error_rad  Standard deviation of Euler angle, in radians.
 * @param[in] beta_error_rad   Standard deviation of Euler angle, in radians.
 * @param[in] gamma_error_rad  Standard deviation of Euler angle, in radians.
 * @param[in,out] status       Status return code.
