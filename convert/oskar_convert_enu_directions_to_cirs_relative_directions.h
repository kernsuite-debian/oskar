/**
 * @brief
 * Converts ENU direction cosines to CIRS relative direction cosines
 * (single precision).
 *
 * @details
 * This function converts topocentric east-north-up vector components for an
 * observer at the given location, to CIRS vector components relative to
 * the given right ascension and declination.
 *
 * Allowance is made for polar motion and diurnal aberration.
 * The magnitude of the diurnal aberration vector can be obtained by calling
 * oskar_evaluate_diurnal_aberration().
 * If not known, these quantities can be set to zero.
 *
 * No allowance is made for atmospheric refraction.
 *
 * To be rigorous, lon_rad is east longitude + s_prime, the direction to the
 * terrestial intermediate origin (TIO). This correction is sufficiently small
 * to be safely neglected for all but the most precise applications.
 *
 * This function uses the same algorithm as implemented in the IAU
 * Standards of Fundamental Astronomy (SOFA) library.
