 * @brief
 * Computes spline data from a list of data points.
 *
 * @details
 * This function constructs splines from a list of data points.
 *
 * @param[in,out] spline         Pointer to spline data structure.
 * @param[in]     num_points     Number of data points in all arrays.
 * @param[in]     x_theta        Array of x or theta positions.
 * @param[in]     y_phi          Array of y or phi positions.
 * @param[in]     z_data         Array of data points.
 * @param[in]     weight         Array of data point weights.
 * @param[in]     fit_type       If set, use a spherical fit; otherwise linear.
 * @param[in]     search_flag    If set, use supplied average fractional error.
 * @param[in,out] avg_frac_error On entry, the target average fractional error;
 *                               on exit, the achieved average fractional error.
 * @param[in]     inc_factor     Factor by which to increase average fractional
 *                               error on failure.
 * @param[in]     smooth_factor  A user-supplied smoothing factor.
 *                               Ignored if \p search_flag parameter is clear.
 * @param[in]     epsilon        Value of epsilon used for the fitting.
 * @param[in,out] status         Status return code.
